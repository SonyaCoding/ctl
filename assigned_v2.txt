Q(qualciv): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 130% of the poverty line. See <a href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/21.682" target=_new>ORS 21.682</a>.

	Q(2.1): If the fee deferral or waiver application and declaration packet didn't open in a new window/tab, you can find it <a href="https://www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/Documents/EntirePacket10.pdf">here</a>. Either way, after you fill it out take it to court and give it to the clerk.
